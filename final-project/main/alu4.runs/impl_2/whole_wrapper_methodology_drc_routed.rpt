2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell whole_i/decoder_0/inst/d1__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) whole_i/two_three_0/inst/d0_reg/PRE, whole_i/two_three_0/inst/d1_reg/PRE, whole_i/two_three_0/inst/d2_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell whole_i/decoder_0/inst/d2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) whole_i/two_three_1/inst/d0_reg/PRE, whole_i/two_three_1/inst/d1_reg/PRE, whole_i/two_three_1/inst/d2_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
